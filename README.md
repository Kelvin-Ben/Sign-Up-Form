# Sign Up Form
> This project is intended to give me a chance to flex some of the new items I‚Äôve been absorbing over the past few lessons. This time it‚Äôs a sign-up form for an imaginary service.

## Built With :hammer_and_wrench: 

- **HTML/CSS best practices:** Correct use of tags, elements, properties and syntax.
- **GitHub flow:**  Correct use of Branches for deployment and features development.
- **Linters Check:** Local and Pull Request check for errors, bugs and stylistic errors in code.
